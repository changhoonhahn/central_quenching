	Abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalog constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder, we investigate the luminosity and stellar mass functions for different populations of galaxies (central versus satellite, red versus blue, and galaxies in groups of different masses) and for groups themselves. The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about three times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low-mass end. At the very low mass end (M * lsim 109 h -2 M sun), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at ~4 × 1010 h -2 M sun. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function of central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation for low-mass halos, and obtain M *,c  vprop M 4.9  h  for Mh Lt 1011 h -1 M sun.},

	Abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M * > 5 × 1010 M &sun; and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * ~ 27 at M * = 4.5 × 1010 M &sun; and Mh = 1.2 × 1012 M &sun;. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot halo mass," M piv  h , and the "pivot ratio," (Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv  h  and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13 × 1010 M &sun; at z = 0.88 to M piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 × 1010 M &sun; at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M piv  h  leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv ~ 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

@article{Behroozi:2013aa,
	Abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M &sun; are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LambdaCDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

@article{Hopkins:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z<~1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z<~1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino (nue) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses (<~1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

@article{Oliver:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We use the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic Legacy Survey (SWIRE) to explore the specific star formation activity of galaxies and their evolution near the peak of the cosmic far-infrared (FIR) background at 70 and 160 mum. We use a stacking analysis to determine the mean FIR properties of well-defined subsets of galaxies at flux levels well below the FIR catalogue detection limits of SWIRE and other Spitzer surveys. We tabulate the contribution of different subsets of galaxies to the FIR background at 70 and 160 mum. These long wavelengths provide a good constraint on the bolometric obscured emission. The large area provides good constraints at low z and in finer redshift bins than previous work. At all redshifts we find that the specific FIR luminosity decreases with increasing mass, following a trend LFIR/M* ~ Mbeta* with beta = -0.38 +/- 0.14. This is a more continuous change than expected from the De Lucia & Blaizot semi-analytic model suggesting modifications to the feedback prescriptions. We see an increase in the specific FIR luminosity by about a factor of ~100 from 0 < z < 2 and find that the specific FIR luminosity evolves as (1 + z)alpha with alpha = 4.4 +/- 0.3 for galaxies with 10.5 < log10 M*/Msolar <= 12. This is considerably steeper than the De Lucia & Blaizot semi-analytic model (alpha ~ 2.5). When separating galaxies into early and late types on the basis of the optical/IR spectral energy distributions we find that the decrease in specific FIR luminosity with stellar mass is stronger in early-type galaxies (beta ~ -0.46), while late-type galaxies exhibit a flatter trend (beta ~ -0.15). The evolution is strong for both classes but stronger for the early-type galaxies. The early types show a trend of decreasing strength of evolution as we move from lower to higher masses while the evolution of the late-type galaxies has little dependence on stellar mass. We suggest that in late-type galaxies we are seeing a consistently declining specific star formation rate alpha = 3.36 +/- 0.16 through a common phenomenon, for example, exhaustion of gas supply, i.e. not systematically dependent on the local properties of the galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for galaxies of different stellar mass by drawing on a deep 3.6 mum selected sample of >105 galaxies in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 < z < 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z) n , where n ~ 4.3 for all galaxies and n ~ 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z>2, at least for high-mass (M * >~ 4 × 1010 M sun) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR vprop M * beta, between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M * ≈ 1010 M sun if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index betaSFG ≈ -0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR-M * relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive (>1010 M sun) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong "downsizing" in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z ~ 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M * = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M sun. In this sense, too, there is no "downsizing." Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.},

	Abstract = {We use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing within the COSMOS survey to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range z = [0.2, 1.0]. For massive galaxies, M * >~ 1010.6 M &sun;, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * ~ 1010 M &sun;, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

@article{Peng:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that dwarf galaxies (107 < M stellar < 109 M &sun;, -12 > Mr > -18) with no active star formation are extremely rare (<0.06%) in the field. Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no Halpha emission (EWHalpha < 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar < 1.0 × 109 M &sun; below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1sigma upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 × 109 M &sun;, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

	Abstract = {Context. Groups of galaxies are a common environment, bridging the gap between starforming field galaxies and quiescent cluster galaxies. Within groups secular processes could be at play, contributing to the observed strong decrease of star formation with cosmic time in the global galaxy population.  Aims: We took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first  10 000 galaxies of the zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study in detail the complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties.  Methods: The classical indicator Fblue, i.e., the fraction of blue galaxies, proved to be a simple but powerful diagnostic tool. We studied its variation for different luminosity and mass selected galaxy samples, divided as to define groups/field/isolated galaxy subsamples.  Results: Using rest-frame evolving B-band volume-limited samples, the groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases, but maintains a systematic difference (a lower Fblue) with respect to the global galaxy population, and an even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population. However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent that such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright blue galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. By carefully focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomes negligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored, i.e., log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) <= 10.6 , does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function of environment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses.  Conclusions: Our results indicate that red galaxies of mass log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) >= 10.8 are already in place at z   1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly originating from so-called nature or internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower galaxy masses and redshifts lower than z   1, we observe the emergence in groups of a population of nurture red galaxies: slightly deviating from the trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, and more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit signatures of group-related secular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution. Our analysis implies that these mechanisms begin to significantly influence galaxy evolution after z   1, a redshift corresponding to the emergence of structures in which these mechanisms take place.  based on data obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 175.A-0839, PI: S.

	Abstract = {We explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over 0.1 < z < 0.7 using the final zCOSMOS-bright data set. Using the red fraction of galaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction of red galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity delta and with the stellar mass M*, consistent with previous works. As at lower redshift, the red fraction appears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of two processes: mass εm(M*) and environmental εrho(delta) quenching. The parameters describing these appear to be essentially the same at z ˜ 0.7 as locally. We explore the relation between red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellite galaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in the central-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samples well matched in stellar mass. There is little evidence for a dependence of the red fraction of centrals on overdensity. Satellites are consistently redder at all overdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency, εsat(delta, M*), increases with overdensity at 0.1 < z < 0.4. This is less marked at higher redshift, but both are nevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. At a given stellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, fsat(delta, M*), also increases with overdensity. The obtained εrho(delta)/fsat(delta, M*) agrees well with εsat(delta, M*), demonstrating that the environmental quenching in the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced by a satellite quenching process at least up to z = 0.7. However, despite the unprecedented size of our high-redshift samples, the associated statistical uncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood as approximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanning a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxies evolve onto the red sequence. The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what fraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. At all redshifts, including z = 0, the data are consistent with ~60% of satellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red sequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red satellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto a larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields a quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same way as halo dynamical times: t Q ~ (1 + z)-1.5. In three of the four samples, the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all central galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make the transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the fourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star formation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A scenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker correlation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger scenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5. These results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red evolves from z = 0.5 to z = 0.},

	Abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LambdaCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at zlesssim 2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z = 0 for virial masses in the range 1011 h-1 M&sun; <= M<= 1015 h-1 M&sun; to lesssim5%, improving on previous results by a factor of 2-3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z = 0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal function at this level or accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ≈20%-50%, depending on the mass definition, from z = 0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

	Abstract = {The kinematics of satellite galaxies reflect the masses of the extended dark matter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosity relation (MLR) of their corresponding central galaxies. In this paper, we select a large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite galaxies as a function of the r-band luminosity of the central galaxies. Using the analytical framework presented in More, van den Bosch & Cacciato, we use these data to infer both the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully taking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking procedure. As expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massive haloes. In addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of a given luminosity, sigmalogM, also increases with increasing luminosity. As we demonstrate, this is consistent with sigmalogL, which reflects the scatter in the conditional probability function P(Lc|M), being independent of halo mass. Our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields sigmalogL = 0.16 +/- 0.04, in excellent agreement with constraints from clustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity in galaxy formation, which is characterized by sigmalogL, is well constrained, independent of halo mass and in a good agreement with current models of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We investigate various galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter halos using a large galaxy group catalog constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder. The conditional luminosity function (CLF) is measured separately for all, red, and blue galaxies, as well as in terms of central and satellite galaxies. The CLFs for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a lognormal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. About 85% of the central galaxies and about 80% of the satellite galaxies in halos with masses Mhgtrsim 1014 h-1 M&sun; are red galaxies. These numbers decrease to 50% and 40%, respectively, in halos with Mh ~ 1012 h-1 M&sun;. For halos of a given mass, the distribution of the luminosities of central galaxies, Lc, has a dispersion of about 0.15 dex. The mean luminosity (stellar mass) of the central galaxies scales with halo mass as Lc propto Mh0.17 (M*,c propto Mh0.22) for halos with masses M gg 1012.5 h-1 M&sun;, and both relations are significantly steeper for less massive halos. We also measure the luminosity and stellar mass gaps between the first and second brightest (most massive) member galaxies, log L1 - log L2 (log M*,1 - log M*,2). These gap statistics, especially in halos with Mhlesssim 1014.0 h-1 M&sun;, indicate that the luminosities of central galaxies are clearly distinct from those of their satellites. The fraction of fossil groups, defined as those groups with log L1 - log L2 >= 0.8, ranges from ~2.5% for groups with Mh ~ 1014 h-1 M&sun; to 18%-60% for groups with Mh ~ 1013 h-1 M&sun;. Finally, we measure the fraction of satellites, which changes from ~5.0% for galaxies with 0.1Mr - 5 log h ~ - 22.0 to ~40% for galaxies with 0.1Mr - 5 log h ~ - 17.0.},

	Abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z~1) and SDSS (z~0) galaxies within the HOD framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies to z~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low-mass halos (~5×1011 h-1 Msolar) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass halos (~1013 h-1 Msolar) result from star formation between z~1 and z~0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.},

@article{Li:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We use a complete and uniform sample of almost half a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to characterize the distribution of stellar mass in the low-redshift Universe. Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and are reasonably but not perfectly fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 × 1010Msolar and with faint-end slope alpha = -1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp < 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc < rp < 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is xi*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84. Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp < 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance Lambdacold dark matter cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude sigma8 ~ 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for the nature of Dark Energy.},

@article{Yang:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associated with the population of dark matter subhalos. The assumption usually made is that the relationship between satellite galaxies and subhalos is similar to that between central galaxies and host halos. In this paper, we use the conditional stellar mass functions of satellite galaxies obtained from a large galaxy group catalog together with models of the subhalo mass functions to explore the consequences of such assumption in connection to the stellar mass function of satellite galaxies and the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxy groups and clusters of different masses. The majority of the stripped stars in massive halos are predicted to end up as intracluster stars, and the predicted amounts of the intracluster component as a function of the velocity dispersion of galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by Gonzalez et al. (2007). The fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain bound in the central and satellite galaxies is the highest (~40% of the total stellar mass) in halos with masses Mh ~ 1014 h -1 M sun. If all these stars end up in the intracluster component (Max), or a maximum amount of these stars is accreted into the central galaxy (Min), then the maximum fraction of the total stars in the whole universe that is in the diffused intracluster component is ~19%, and the minimum is ~5%. In the case of "Max," the stellar mass of the intracluster component in massive halos with Mh ~ 1015 h -1 M sun is roughly six times as large as that of the central galaxy. This factor decreases to ~2, 1, and 0.1 in halos with Mh ~ 1014, 1013, and 1012 h -1 M sun, respectively. The total amount of stars stripped from satellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in halos with masses lsim1012.5 h -1 M sun, and so the quenching of star formation must occur in halos with higher masses. In semianalytical models and simulations that do not resolve the diffused component, caution must be exercised when using the observed stellar mass/luminosity function of galaxies to constrain the star formation, feedback and merger processes in dark matter halos.},

@article{Leja:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how to associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density rather than fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al. semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically, we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection reproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities. We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally based corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex). We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat uncertain.},

@article{Conroy:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance LambdaCDM cosmology (Omega0=1-OmegaLambda=0.3, h=0.7, sigma8=0.9) to model the observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxy clustering through most of the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. We use a simple, nonparametric model, which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations, Vaccmax reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation, Vnowmax. The simulations and our model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1 over the entire probed range of projected separations, 0.1<rp/(h-1 Mpc)<10.0. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn. This suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter halos.},

@article{Vale:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Non-parametric, empirically based, models for associating galaxy luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale & Ostriker version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass, cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as Ltot ~M0.88, while the luminosity of the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L1 ~ M0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately L ~ M4.5 for M ~ 1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as ~M0.9.  In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for Omegam and sigma8. Within the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around Omegam = 0.25 and sigma8 = 0.8; this is also in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.},

	Abstract = {Galaxies are believed to be in one-to-one correspondence with simulated dark matter subhaloes. We use high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological volumes to calculate the statistical properties of subhalo (galaxy) major mergers at high redshift (z = 0.6-5). We measure the evolution of the galaxy merger rate, finding that it is much shallower than the merger rate of dark matter host haloes at z > 2.5, but roughly parallels that of haloes at z < 1.6. We also track the detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo. We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15-35 per cent of all recently merged galaxies are satellites, and satellites are twice as likely as centrals to have had a recent major merger. Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of haloes and galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo, noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at z ~ 2.5.},

	Abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

@article{White:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion).  We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators.  We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group finders to recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. To test the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

@article{Tinker:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between f_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

@article{Brinchmann:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

	Abstract = {Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0<z<1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types---spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems---and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

@article{Cooper:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Using a sample of 19464 galaxies drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between galaxy colour and environment at 0.4 < z < 1.35. We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends strongly on local environment out to z > 1, being larger in regions of greater galaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red, morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured overdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local overdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z > 1 detected at a greater than 5sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find that the colour-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more strongly favouring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence counterparts at high redshift. At z >~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly correlates with overdensity, implying that any colour dependence to the clustering of ~L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add weight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence has occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e. galaxy groups) at z <~ 1.5. Furthermore, we identify the epoch (z ~ 2) at which typical ~L* galaxies began quenching and moved on to the red sequence in significant number. The strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 < z < 1.35 suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-density and colour-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms (i.e. `nurture') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by `nature') upon the galaxy population during their epoch of formation.},

	Abstract = {We use data drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey to investigate the relationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass and rest-frame galaxy colour. At z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at the high-mass [ log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) > 10.1] end depends on the local environment, with high-density regions favouring more massive systems. Accounting for this stellar mass-environment relation (i.e. working at fixed stellar mass), we find a significant colour-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 < log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) < 11.1 and 0.75 < z < 0.95. This result is shown to be robust to variations in the sample selection and to extend to even lower masses [down to log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) ~ 10.4]. We conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works in the literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxy properties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift and stellar mass domain. The non-detection of environmental dependence found in other data sets is largely attributable to their smaller sample sizes and lower sampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshifts and biased analysis techniques. Ultimately, our results based on DEEP2 data illustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusively determined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. Instead, we show that local environment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxy properties at z > 1.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {We present the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS), a spectroscopic faint galaxy redshift survey to z ~ 1. PRIMUS uses a low-dispersion prism and slitmasks to observe ~2500 objects at once in a 0.18 deg2 field of view, using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph camera on the Magellan I Baade 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. PRIMUS covers a total of 9.1 deg2 of sky to a depth of i AB ~ 23.5 in seven different deep, multi-wavelength fields that have coverage from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and either XMM or Chandra, as well as multiple-band optical and near-IR coverage. PRIMUS includes ~130,000 robust redshifts of unique objects with a redshift precision of sigma z /(1 + z) ~ 0.005. The redshift distribution peaks at z ~ 0.6 and extends to z = 1.2 for galaxies and z = 5 for broad-line active galactic nuclei. The motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented here, with a brief summary of the redshift precision; a forthcoming paper presents the data reduction, redshift fitting, redshift confidence, and survey completeness. PRIMUS is the largest faint galaxy survey undertaken to date. The high targeting fraction (~80%) and large survey size will allow for precise measures of galaxy properties and large-scale structure to z ~ 1.},

@article{Drory:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of stellar mass functions in the COSMOS field to fainter limits than has been previously probed at z <= 1. The increase in dynamic range reveals features in the shape of the stellar mass function that deviate from a single Schechter function. Neither the total nor the red (passive) or blue (star-forming) galaxy stellar mass functions can be well fitted with a single Schechter function once the mass completeness limit of the sample probes below ~3 × 109 M sun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses ~1010 M sun, just below the traditional M*, and an upturn toward a steep faint-end slope of alpha ~ -1.7 at lower mass at all redshifts <=1. This bimodal nature of the mass function is not solely a result of the blue/red dichotomy. Indeed, the blue mass function is by itself bimodal at z ~ 1. This suggests a new dichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence. We propose two interpretations for this bimodal distribution. If the gas fraction increases toward lower mass, galaxies with M baryon ~ 1010 M sun would shift to lower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change in star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming much more efficient below ~1010 M sun. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in the baryonic (stars+gas) mass function. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at ~1011 M sun, a phenomenon that naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M halo ~ 1012 M sun. In this scenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M * would be identified with central galaxies and the second fainter component of the mass function having a steep faint-end slope with satellite galaxies. The low-mass end of the blue and total mass functions exhibit a steeper slope than has been detected in previous work that may increasingly approach the halo mass function value of -2. While the dip feature is apparent in the total mass function at all redshifts, it appears to shift from the blue to the red population, likely as a result of transforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect a drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies. Their increase with time seems to reflect a decrease in the number of blue systems and so we tentatively associate them with satellite dwarf (spheroidal) galaxies that have undergone quenching due to environmental processes.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i < 23 flux-limited sample of ~40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ≈5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ~170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30% increase in the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 0.6, and a <~ 10% change in the number density of all >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z ≈ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z ≈ 0.6, whereas the space density of >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies decreases by ≈50% between z ≈ 1 and z ≈ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~1010.8  {M}_{\odot }. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z < 1, even among massive (gsim 1011  {M}_{\odot }) quiescent galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyse a z < 0.1 galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey focusing on the variation in the galaxy colour bimodality with stellar mass and projected neighbour density Sigma, and on measurements of the galaxy stellar mass functions. The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 1010.6 to (Kroupa initial mass function, H0 = 70) for Sigma in the range 0.1-10Mpc-2. The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in logSigma and bins). The red fraction fr generally increases continuously in both Sigma and such that there is a unified relation: . Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction ({{f}Q}) from z=0.8 to 0.0 using spectroscopic redshifts and multi-wavelength imaging data from the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our stellar mass limited galaxy sample consists of ˜14,000 PRIMUS galaxies within z = 0.2-0.8 and ˜64,000 SDSS galaxies within z = 0.05-0.12. We classify the galaxies as quiescent or star-forming (SF) based on an evolving specific star formation cut, and as low or high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture environment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining population. For quiescent and SF galaxies in low or high density environments, we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function (SMF). Then using the SMFs we compute {{f}Q}({{M}*}) and quantify its evolution within our redshift range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at higher masses and in denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises with cosmic time for all masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of {{10}10.5} {{M}&sun; }, from z˜ 0.7 to 0.1, the quiescent fraction rises by 15% at the lowest environments and by 25% at the highest environments we measure. These results suggest that for a minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to external influences on them. In other words, in the recent universe a substantial fraction of the galaxies that cease forming stars do so due to internal processes.},

@article{Gu:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the $z=0$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lesssim$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale ($M_{\rm vir}>10^{14}{M_\odot}$) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx0.16$ dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since $z\approx2$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of $0.2$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from $10^{12}{M_\odot}<M_{\rm vir}<10^{14.75}{M_\odot}$. The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at $z=0$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is determined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

	Abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

	Abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central (`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of Mstar > 5 × 109 M&sun; at z ≈ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z ˜ 0.5, or ˜5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar < 1010 M&sun;. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of <0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

@article{Blanton:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.
