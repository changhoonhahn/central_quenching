	Abstract = {We test whether halo age and galaxy age are correlated at fixed halo and galaxy mass. The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos correlate with their large-scale density $\rho$, an effect known as assembly bias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the dependence of galaxy stellar age on $\rho$. To clarify the comparison between theory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on satellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and measure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale environment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong positive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\rho$. However, we show that the amplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias is significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those halos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced strong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather than current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\rm gal}\gtrsim 10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\sim 5\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to high densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos using peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation of $f_Q$ with $\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the data across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This implies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant impact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching process in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation history.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 < z < 4. We construct a large, deep (Ks < 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of sigmaDeltaz/(1 + z) = 0.008 at i+ < 22.5 and sigmaDeltaz/(1 + z) = 0.03 at 1.5 < z < 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies more massive than M â‰³ 1010.7 - 10.9M&sun;. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z < 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z ~ 3 to z ~ 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z ~ 3 and z ~ 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z < 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z < 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z > 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 - 10.5M&sun; galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 < z < 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 Ks -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50%, 10%, and 1% of its current value at z ~ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as rhostarvprop(1 + z)-4.7 $\pm$ 0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as rhostarvprop(1 + z)-2.3 $\pm$ 0.2. At z > 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z < 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M star/M &sun;) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(M star/M &sun;) = 10.5 have grown by >1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

@article{Woo:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we adopt the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram as a diagnostic tool to understand the nature of quenching in different environments. sSFR is the specific star formation rate, and $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ is the stellar surface density in the inner kpc. Although both the host halo mass and group-centric distance affect the satellite population, we find that these two properties can be characterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features of the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the "environment". Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases smoothly with the quenched fraction of a given environment. Furthermore, the location of the transition galaxies (i.e., the "green valley" or GV) in the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram also varies smoothly with the environment, $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ being lower for satellites than the field, and lower for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial distances within the same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the relative importance in different environments of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching track. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram are most significant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 < \log M_{*}/M_{\odot} < 10$). One feature of the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M_{*}$ quenched galaxies have higher $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ than the star-forming population. These results disfavour scenarios that quench satellites without any (subsequent) change in $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ or $M_{*}$. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the difference in $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ between GV and quenched satellites.},

	Abstract = {Does galaxy evolution proceed through the green valley via multiple pathways or as a single population? Motivated by recent results highlighting radically different evolutionary pathways between early- and late-type galaxies, we present results from a simple Bayesian approach to this problem wherein we model the star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy with two parameters, [t, tau] and compare the predicted and observed optical and near-ultraviolet colours. We use a novel method to investigate the morphological differences between the most probable SFHs for both disc-like and smooth-like populations of galaxies, by using a sample of 126 316 galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.25) with probabilistic estimates of morphology from Galaxy Zoo. We find a clear difference between the quenching time-scales preferred by smooth- and disc-like galaxies, with three possible routes through the green valley dominated by smooth- (rapid time-scales, attributed to major mergers), intermediate- (intermediate time-scales, attributed to minor mergers and galaxy interactions) and disc-like (slow time-scales, attributed to secular evolution) galaxies. We hypothesize that morphological changes occur in systems which have undergone quenching with an exponential time-scale tau < 1.5 Gyr, in order for the evolution of galaxies in the green valley to match the ratio of smooth to disc galaxies observed in the red sequence. These rapid time-scales are instrumental in the formation of the red sequence at earlier times; however, we find that galaxies currently passing through the green valley typically do so at intermediate time-scales.â€ },

	Abstract = {The cosmic noon (z Ëœ 1.5-3) marked a period of vigorous star formation for most galaxies. However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times were quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are inconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is often attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black holes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe is not yet definitively established. We analyse the origin of quiescent galaxies with the help of ultrahigh resolution, cosmological simulations that include feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of black hole feedback. We show that dark matter haloes with specific accretion rates below Ëœ0.25-0.4 Gyr-1 preferentially host galaxies with reduced star formation rates and red broad-band colours. The fraction of such haloes in large dark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent galaxies (Ëœ1010-1011 M&sun;). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate is the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z Ëœ 1.5-3 become quiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as halo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link between galaxy properties and the masses of their parent haloes. These models will benefit from adding the specific accretion rate of haloes as a second model parameter.},

	Abstract = {We use the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation to constrain galaxy evolution models. If the efficiency of converting accreted baryons into stars varies with time, halos of the same present-day mass but different formation histories will have different z=0 galaxy stellar mass. This is one of the sources of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$. For massive halos that undergo rapid quenching of star formation at z~2, different mechanisms that trigger this quenching yield different values of $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$. We use this framework to test various models in which quenching begins after a galaxy crosses a threshold in one of the following physical quantities: redshift, halo mass, stellar mass, and stellar-to-halo mass ratio. Our model is highly idealized, with other sources of scatter likely to arise as more physics is included. Thus, our test is whether a model can produce scatter lower than observational bounds, leaving room for other sources. Recent measurements find $\sigma_{\log M\ast}=0.16$ dex for 10^11 Msol galaxies. Under the assumption that the threshold is constant with time, such a low value of $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$ rules out all of these models with the exception of quenching by a stellar mass treshold. Most physical quantities, such as metallicity, will increase scatter if they are uncorrelated with halo formation history. Thus, to decrease the scatter of a given model, galaxy properties would correlate tightly with formation history, creating testable predictions for their clustering. Understanding why $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$ is so small may be key to understanding the physics of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We present a semi-empirical model to infer the atomic and molecular hydrogen content of galaxies as a function of halo mass and time. Our model combines the star formation rate (SFR)-halo mass-redshift relation (constrained by galaxy abundances) with inverted SFR-surface density relations to infer galaxy H I and H2 masses. We present gas scaling relations, gas fractions, and mass functions from z = 0 to 3 and the gas properties of galaxies as a function of their host halo masses. Predictions of our work include: (1) there is an Ëœ0.2 dex decrease in the H I mass of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass since z = 1.5, whereas the H2 mass of galaxies decreases by >1 dex over the same period; (2) galaxy cold gas fractions and H2 fractions decrease with increasing stellar mass and time. Galaxies with M* > 1010 M&sun; are dominated by their stellar content at z <= 1, whereas less-massive galaxies only reach these gas fractions at z = 0. We find the strongest evolution in relative gas content at z < 1.5; (3) the SFR to gas mass ratio decreases by an order of magnitude from z = 3 to 0. This is accompanied by lower H2 fractions; these lower fractions in combination with smaller gas reservoirs correspond to decreased present-day galaxy SFRs; (4) an H2-based star formation relation can simultaneously fuel the evolution of the cosmic star formation and reproduce the observed weak evolution in the cosmic H I density; (5) galaxies residing in haloes with masses near 1012 M&sun; are most efficient at obtaining large gas reservoirs and forming H2 at all redshifts. These two effects lie at the origin of the high star formation efficiencies in haloes with the same mass.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the `Illustris zoom simulation project', which allows the study of selected galaxies forming in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a 40 times better mass resolution than in the parent large-scale hydrodynamical Illustris simulation. We here focus on the starburst properties of the gas in four cosmological simulations of major mergers. The galaxies in our high-resolution zoom runs exhibit a bursty mode of star formation with gas consumption timescales 10 times shorter than for the normal star formation mode. The strong bursts are only present in the simulations with the highest resolution, hinting that a too low resolution is the reason why the original Illustris simulation showed a dearth of starburst galaxies. Very pronounced bursts of star formation occur in two out of four major mergers we study. The high star formation rates, the short gas consumption timescales and the morphology of these systems strongly resemble observed nuclear starbursts. This is the first time that a sample of major mergers is studied through self-consistent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations instead of using isolated galaxy models setup on a collision course. We also study the orbits of the colliding galaxies and find that the starbursting gas preferentially appears in head-on mergers with very high collision velocities. Encounters with large impact parameters do typically not lead to the formation of starbursting gas.},

@article{Hahn:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure (LSS) assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. They are also typically restricted to measurements such as the two point correlation function. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) make inference possible without assuming any functional form for the likelihood, thereby relaxing the assumptions and restrictions of the standard approach. Instead it relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

@article{Muldrew:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied and compared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are often used to define environment. Most methods fall into two broad groups: those that use nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that use fixed apertures. The differences between the two inhibit a clean comparison between analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data, different properties are actually being measured. In this work, we apply 20 published environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrained to look like the local Universe. We find that nearest-neighbour-based measures best probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses the interhalo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local density variations. The resulting correlation also shows that nearest-neighbour galaxy environment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. Conversely, aperture-based methods that probe superhalo scales accurately identify high-density regions corresponding to high-mass haloes. Both methods show how galaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of the largest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the background dark matter environment. We also warn against using photometric redshifts to define environment in all but the densest regions. When considering environment, there are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measured with nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo best measured with apertures. This leads to the conclusion that there is no universal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scale being probed.},

	Abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function <N>M for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1~14Mmin (SPH) or M1~18Mmin (SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M~10Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a ``bump'' at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiscale approach for measurements of galaxy density, applied to a volume-limited sample constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 (SDSS DR5). We populate a rich parameter space by obtaining independent measurements of density on different scales for each galaxy. This parametrization purely relies on observations and avoids the implicit assumptions involved, e.g. in the construction of group catalogues. As the first application of this method, we study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (specifically u - r) depends on multiscale density. The u - r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum of two Gaussians (a red and a blue one) with five parameters: the fraction of red galaxies (fred) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mured,mublue,sigmared and sigmablue). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<0.5Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common (larger fred), redder (larger mured) and with a narrower distribution (smaller sigmared), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mublue) but with a broader distribution (larger sigmablue). There are residual correlations of fred and mublue with 0.5-1Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of star formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales. Beyond 1Mpc (0.5Mpc for mured) there are no positive correlations with density. However fred anticorrelates with density on >2Mpc scales at fixed density on smaller scales, and mured anticorrelates with density on >1Mpc scales. We examine these trends qualitatively in the context of the halo model, utilizing the properties of haloes within which the galaxies are embedded, derived by Yang et al. and applied to a group catalogue. This yields an excellent description of the trends with multiscale density, including the anticorrelations on large scales, which map the region of accretion on to massive haloes. Thus we conclude that galaxies become red only once they have been accreted on to haloes of a certain mass. The mean colour of red galaxies mured depends positively only on <0.5Mpc scale density, which can most easily be explained if correlations of mured with environment are driven by metallicity via the enrichment history of a galaxy within its subhalo, during its epoch of star formation.},

	Abstract = {Successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and the bimodality in the galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formation in massive haloes. Current models of galaxy formation consider two such truncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. The efficiencies of these processes set the blue fraction of galaxies, fblue(L, M), as a function of galaxy luminosity, L, and halo mass, M. In this paper, we use a galaxy group catalogue extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine fblue(L, M). To demonstrate the potential power of these data as a benchmark for galaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical model for galaxy formation of Croton et al. Although this model accurately fits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape of the conditional LF, there are significant discrepancies when the blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is compared between the observations and the model. In particular, the model predicts (i) too many faint satellites in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction of satellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that is too high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. In the same order, we argue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in the semi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and (iii) improper modelling of dust extinction and/or AGN feedback. The data presented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxy formation and, in particular, to discriminate between various models for AGN feedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy morphologies in clusters have undergone a remarkable transition over the past several billion yr. Distant clusters at z ~ 0.4 are filled with small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence of multiple bursts of star formation. This population is absent from nearby clusters, where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function. Our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a rich cluster resulting from encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidal field, or ``galaxy harassment.'' After a bursting transient phase, they undergo a complete morphological transformation from ``disks'' to ``spheroidals.'' We examine the remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of the photometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. Our model naturally accounts for the intermediate-age stellar population seen in these spheroidals, as well as for the trend in the dwarf-to-giant ratio with cluster richness. The final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocity anisotropy. Their mass-to-light ratios are in the range 3-8, in good agreement with observations.},

@article{Balogh:2000aa,
	Abstract = {We examine the origin of clustercentric gradients in the star formation rates and colors of rich cluster galaxies within the context of a simple model where clusters are built through the ongoing accretion of field galaxies. The model assumes that after galaxies enter the cluster their star formation rates decline on a timescale of a few gigayears, the typical gas consumption timescale of disk galaxies in the field. Such behavior might be expected if tides and ram pressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in spirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion histories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a LambdaCDM universe, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color distribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression of star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric radius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies beyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of the cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in the outskirts of clusters (and as far out as 2 virial radii) is systematically suppressed relative to the field. The agreement with the data beyond the cluster virial radius is also improved if we assume that stripping happens within lower mass systems, before the galaxy is accreted into the main body of the cluster. We conclude that the star formation rates of cluster galaxies depend primarily on the time elapsed since their accretion onto massive virialized systems and that the cessation of star formation may have taken place gradually over a few gigayears.},

	Abstract = {The relation between spiral and S0 galaxies is considered in the light of recent data on the colors and morphology of disk systems and on the content of clusters at different redshifts. It is suggested that S0's may be disk systems that lost their gas-rich envelopes at an early stage and consumed their remaining gas by star formation. The fact that S0's have smaller disk-to-bulge ratios than spirals is consistent with this picture, as are the colors of S0's if most of their star formation stopped at least a few gigayears ago.},

@article{Bekki:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We numerically investigate the evolution of gaseous haloes around disc galaxies in different environments, ranging from small groups to rich clusters, in order to understand galaxy evolution in these environments. Our simulations self-consistently incorporate the effects of ram pressure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) on the disc and halo gas of galaxies and hydrodynamical interaction between disc and halo gas, so that the mass fractions of halo gas stripped by ram pressure of the IGM (Fstrip) can be better estimated. We mainly investigate how Fstrip depends on the total masses of the host environments (Mhost), galactic masses (Mgal), densities and temperature of the IGM (TIGM and rhoIGM, respectively), the relative velocities between the IGM and galaxies (Vr) and the physical properties of discs (e.g. gas mass fraction). We find that typically 60-80 per cent of halo gas can be efficiently stripped from Milky-Way-type disc galaxies by ram pressure in clusters with Mhost ~ 1014Msolar. We also find that Fstrip depends on Mhost such that Fstrip is higher for larger Mhost. Furthermore, it is found that Fstrip can be higher in disc galaxies with smaller Mgal for a given environment. Our simulations demonstrate that the presence of disc gas can suppress ram-pressure stripping of halo gas, owing to hydrodynamical interaction between halo and disc gas. Ram-pressure stripping of halo gas is found to be efficient (i.e. Fstrip > 0.5) even in small and/or compact groups, if rhoIGM ~ 105Msolarkpc-3 and Vr ~ 400kms-1. Based on the derived radial distributions of the remaining halo gas after ram-pressure stripping, we propose that the truncation of star formation after halo-gas stripping can occur from the outside in in disc galaxies. We suggest that although the gradual truncation of star formation in disc galaxies can occur in groups, this proceeds less rapidly in comparison with cluster environments. We also suggest that low-mass galaxies are likely to truncate their star formation more rapidly, owing to more efficient halo-gas stripping in groups and clusters.},

	Abstract = {We study the clustering of galaxies in real and redshift space using the Optical Redshift Survey (ORS). We estimate the two-point correlation function in redshift space, xi(s), for several subsamples of ORS, spanning nearly a factor of 30 in volume. We detect significant variations in xi(s) among the subsamples covering small volumes. For volumes âª†(75 h-1Mpc)3, however, the ORS subsamples present very similar clustering patterns. Fits of the form xi(s)=(s/s0)exp(-gammas) give best-fitting values in the range 1.5 <= gammas<= 1.7 and 6.5 <= s0<= 8.8 h-1Mpc for several samples extending to redshifts of 8000 km s-1. However, in several cases xi(s) is not well described by a single power-law, rendering the best-fitting values quite sensitive to the interval in s adopted. We find significant differences in clustering between the diameter-limited and magnitude-limited ORS samples within a radius of 4000 km s-1 centred on the Local Group; xi(s) is larger for the magnitude - limited sample than for the diameter - limited one.  We interpret this as an indirect result of the morphological segregation coupled with differences in morphological mix. We split ORS into different morphological subsamples and confirm the existence of morphological segregation of galaxies out to scales of s â‰¡ 10 h-1Mpc. The results indicate that the relative bias factor between early- and late-type galaxies may be weakly dependent on scale. If real, this would suggest non-linear biasing.  We also compute correlations as a function of radial and projected separations, xi(rp,pi), from which we derive the real-space correlation function, xi(r). We obtain values 4.9<=r0<=7.3h-1 Mpc and 1.5<=gammarâ‰¼1.7 for various ORS samples. As before, these values depend strongly on the range in r adopted for the fit. The results obtained in real space confirm those found using xi(s), i. e. in small volumes; magnitude-limited samples show larger clustering than do diameter-limited ones. There is no difference when large volumes are considered. Our results prove to be robust to adoption of different estimators of xi(s) and to alternative methods of compensating for sampling selection effects.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a study of the galaxy populations in 55 rich clusters along with a discussion of the implications for the formation and/or evolution of different morphological types. A well defined relationship is found between local galaxy density and galaxy type, which indicates an increasing elliptical and S0 population and a corresponding decrease in spirals with increasing density. Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

	Abstract = {In the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change due to the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, and mergers with other galaxies. Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z~0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z~1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z~1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in 0.1(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ``dry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z~0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z~1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We characterize the mass-dependent evolution of more than 8000 galaxies using spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey in the range 0.4<z<1.4 and stellar masses calculated from K-band photometry obtained at Palomar Observatory. This sample spans more than 1.5 deg2 in four independent fields. Using rest-frame U-B color and [O II] equivalent widths, we distinguish star-forming from passive populations in order to explore the nature of ``downsizing''-a pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high-mass galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass. We find that MQ decreases with time by a factor of ~3 across our redshift range according to MQ~(1+z)3.5. To further constrain possible quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic Dp,3. For the majority of galaxies near the median density, there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment. However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median. Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of stellar mass estimates for a sample of 25000 galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey over the interval 0.2 < z < 1.0. We have developed, implemented, and tested a new method of estimating stellar mass-to-light ratios, which relies on redshift and spectral energy distribution (SED) classification from 5 broadband and 12 medium band filters. We find that the majority (>60%) of massive galaxies with M* > 1011 M&sun; at all z < 1 are non-star-forming; blue star-forming galaxies dominate at lower masses. We have used these mass estimates to explore the evolution of the stellar mass function since z =1. We find that the total stellar mass density of the universe has roughly doubled since z Ëœ 1. Our measurements are consistent with other measurements of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time and with estimates of the time evolution of the cosmic star formation rate. Intriguingly, the integrated stellar mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly changed since z Ëœ 1, even though these galaxies host the majority of the star formation: instead, the growth of the total stellar mass density is dominated by the growth of the total mass in the largely passive galaxies on the red sequence.},

@article{Madau:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at zâ‰ˆ1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than Ëœ1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	Abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 < z < 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log (M sstarf) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

	Abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 with KVega<22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z~2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8mum<1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8mum>1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 mum-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived (>~400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z>1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

@article{Elbaz:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Aims:We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, GOODS, at zËœ1.   Methods: We use ultradeep imaging at 24 mum with the MIPS camera onboard {Spitzer} to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8<= z <=1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of  1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard {Spitzer}.   Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at zËœ 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z>2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at zËœ 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the  1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at zËœ1. The SFR of zËœ1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/Mstar) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at zËœ 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals.   Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at zËœ1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.},

@article{Wyder:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. In the (NUV-r)0.1 versus Mr,0.1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV-r)0.1 color distribution at each Mr,0.1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to Mr,0.1~-23. The r0.1-band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~1010.5 Msolar, galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

	Abstract = {Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S{\'e}rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h-1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5<M0.1i<-17.0 mag and 17<mu0.1i<24 mag in 1 arcsec2 [the notation zb represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.

@article{Kauffmann:2003aa,
	Abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HdeltaA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5Ã— 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

	Abstract = {The PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) is a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey to z ~ 1 completed with a low-dispersion prism and slitmasks allowing for simultaneous observations of ~2500 objects over 0.18 deg2. The final PRIMUS catalog includes ~130,000 robust redshifts over 9.1 deg2. In this paper, we summarize the PRIMUS observational strategy and present the data reduction details used to measure redshifts, redshift precision, and survey completeness. The survey motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented in Coil et al. Comparisons to existing higher-resolution spectroscopic measurements show a typical precision of sigma z /(1 + z) = 0.005. PRIMUS, both in area and number of redshifts, is the largest faint galaxy redshift survey completed to date and is allowing for precise measurements of the relationship between active galactic nuclei and their hosts, the effects of environment on galaxy evolution, and the build up of galactic systems over the latter half of cosmic history.},

@article{Lilly:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale (Îµ-1) and the mass loading lambda of the wind outflow lambdaÂ·SFR. The simplest regulator, in which Îµ and lambda are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on Îµ, lambda, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if Îµ and lambda depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters Îµ and lambda themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard LambdaCDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding Îµ and lambda as functions of m star. The fitted Îµ is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted lambda is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 < z < 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.},

	Abstract = {We present analysis of the near-infrared spectra of 114 rest-frame UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z~2. By combining the Halpha spectra with photometric measurements from observed 0.3-8 mum, we assess the relationships among kinematics, dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions, and stellar masses and ages. The Halpha line widths give a mean dynamical mass Mdyn=(6.9+/-0.6)Ã—1010 Msolar within a typical radius of ~6 kpc, after excluding AGNs. The average dynamical mass is ~2 times larger than the average stellar mass, and the two agree to within a factor of several for most objects. However, ~15% of the sample has Mdyn>>M*. These objects are best fit by young stellar populations and tend to have high Halpha equivalent widths, WHalpha>~200 {\AA}, suggesting that they are young starbursts with large gas masses. Rest-frame optical luminosity and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma significance. Using the local empirical correlation between star formation rate per unit area and gas surface density, we estimate the mass of the gas associated with star formation and find a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a strong decrease in gas fraction with increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas and stars combined are considerably better correlated with the dynamical masses than are the stellar masses alone, and agree to within a factor of 3 for 85% of the sample. The combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses, and stellar population properties suggest that the factor of ~500 range in stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully explained by intrinsic differences in the total masses of the galaxies, which vary by a factor of ~40 the remaining variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and the conversion of gas into stars.  Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {I investigate the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of galaxies with extended 21 cm rotation curves spanning the range 20 km s-1<~Vf<=300 km s-1. A variety of scalings of the stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon* are considered. For each prescription for Upsilon*, I give fits of the form Md=AVxf. Presumably, the prescription that comes closest to the correct value will minimize the scatter in the relation. The fit with minimum scatter has A=50 Msolar km-4 s4 and x=4. This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar fraction, and Upsilon* are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface brightness galaxies typically have Upsilon*~3/4 of the maximum disk value, while low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~1/4 of this amount.},

We extend the main scaling relations concerning the total and the molecular gas component determined for massive galaxies (Mstar â‰³ 1010 M&sun;) from the COLD GASS survey down to stellar masses Mstar ~= 109 M&sun;. As scaling variables we use the total stellar mass Mstar, the stellar surface density mustar, the specific star formation rate SSFR, and the metallicity of the target galaxies. By comparing molecular gas masses determined using a constant or a luminosity dependent XCO conversion factor, we estimate the robustness of these scaling relations on the very uncertain assumptions used to transform CO line intensities into molecular gas masses. The molecular gas distribution of a K-band-selected sample is significantly different from that of a far-infrared-selected sample since it includes a significantly smaller number of objects with M(H2) â‰² 6 Ã— 109 M&sun;. In spiral galaxies the molecular gas phase is only 25-30% of the atomic gas. The analysis also indicates that the slope of the main scaling relations depends on the adopted conversion factor. Among the sampled relations, all those concerning M(gas)/Mstar are statistically significant and show little variation with XCO. We observe a significant correlation between M(H2)/Mstar and SSFR, M(H2)/M(Hi) and mustar, M(H2)/M(Hi) and 12 + log (O/H), regardless of the adopted XCO. The total and molecular gas consumption timescales are anticorrelated with the specific star formation rate. The comparison of HRS and COLD GASS data indicates that some of the observed scaling relations are nonlinear.},

@article{Stewart:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations and observationally normalized relations between dark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to derive robust expectations about the baryonic content of major mergers out to redshift z ~ 2. First, we find that the majority of major mergers (m/M>0.3) experienced by the Milky Way size dark matter halos should have been gas-rich, and that gas-rich mergers are increasingly common at high redshifts. Though the frequency of major mergers into galaxy halos in our simulations greatly exceeds the observed early-type galaxy fraction, the frequency of gas-poor major mergers is consistent with the observed fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies across the halo mass range M DM ~ 1011-1013 M sun. These results lend support to the conjecture that mergers with high-baryonic gas fractions play an important role in building and/or preserving disk galaxies in the universe. Second, we find that there is a transition mass below which a galaxy's past major mergers were primarily gas-rich and above which they were gas-poor. The associated stellar mass scale corresponds closely to that marking the observed bimodal division between blue, star-forming, disk-dominated systems and red, bulge-dominated systems with old populations. Finally, we find that the overall fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons deposited directly via major mergers is significant. Approximately ~20%-30% of the cold baryonic material in M star ~ 1010.5 M sun (M DM ~ 1012 M sun) galaxies is accreted as cold gas or stars via major mergers since z = 2, with most of this accretion in the form of cold gas. For more massive galaxies with M star ~ 1011 M sun (M DM ~ 1013 M sun), the fraction of baryons amassed in mergers since z = 2 is even higher, ~40%, but most of these accreted baryons are delivered directly in the form of stars. This baryonic mass deposition is almost unavoidable, and provides a limit on the fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons that can originate in cold flows or from hot halo cooling.},

@article{Birnboim:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We simulate the build-up of galaxies by spherical gas accretion through dark matter haloes, subject to the development of virial shocks. We find that a uniform cosmological accretion rate turns into a rapidly varying disc build-up rate. The generic sequence of events (Shocked-Accretion Massive Burst and Shutdown, SAMBA) consists of four distinct phases: (i) continuous cold accretion while the halo is below a threshold mass Msh ~ 1012Msolar, (ii) tentative quenching of gas supply for ~2Gyr, starting abruptly once the halo is ~Msh and growing a rapidly expanding shock, (iii) a massive burst due to the collapse of ~1011Msolar gas in ~0.5Gyr, when the accumulated heated gas cools and joins new infalling gas and (iv) a long-term shutdown, enhanced by a temporary shock instability in late SAMBAs, those that quench at z ~ 2, burst at z ~ 1 and end up quenched in 1012-13Msolar haloes today. The quenching and bursting occur at all redshifts in galaxies of baryonic mass ~1011Msolar and involve a substantial fraction of this mass. They arise from rather smooth accretion, or minor mergers, which, unlike major mergers, may leave the disc intact while being built in a rapid pace. The early bursts match observed maximum starbursting discs at z >~ 2, predicted to reside in <~1013Msolar haloes. The late bursts resemble discy luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z <~ 1. On the other hand, the tentative quenching gives rise to a substantial population of ~1011Msolar galaxies with a strongly suppressed star formation rate at z ~ 1-3. The predicted long-term shutdown leads to red and dead galaxies in groups. A complete shutdown in more massive clusters requires an additional quenching mechanism, as may be provided by clumpy accretion. Alternatively, the SAMBA bursts may trigger the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity that couples to the hot gas above Msh and helps the required quenching. The SAMBA phenomenon is predicted based on a spherical model that does not simulate star formation and feedback - it is yet to be investigated using detailed cosmological simulations.},

@article{Cattaneo:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We reproduce the blue and red sequences in the observed joint distribution of colour and magnitude for galaxies at low and high redshifts using hybrid N-body/semi-analytic simulations of galaxy formation. The match of model and data is achieved by mimicking the effects of cold flows versus shock heating coupled to feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as predicted by Dekel and Birnboim. After a critical epoch z ~ 3, only haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock ~ 1012Msolar enjoy gas supply by cold flows and form stars, while cooling and star formation are shut down abruptly above this mass. The shock-heated gas is kept hot because being dilute it is vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as AGNs in their self-regulated mode. The shutdown explains in detail the bright-end truncation of the blue sequence at ~L*, the appearance of luminous red-and-dead galaxies on the red sequence starting already at z ~ 2, the colour bimodality, its strong dependence on environment density and its correlations with morphology and other galaxy properties. Before z ~ 2-3, even haloes above the shock-heating mass form stars by cold streams penetrating through the hot gas. This explains the bright star forming galaxies at z ~ 3-4, the early appearance of massive galaxies on the red sequence, the high cosmological star formation rate at high redshifts and the subsequent low rate at low redshifts.},

@article{Dekel:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass ~3 Ã— 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z~ 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z~ 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock<~ 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>=Mshock haloes preferentially at z>= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L > L* galaxies. At z < 2, in M > Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z~ 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

@article{Keres:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. About half of the gas follows the track expected in the conventional picture of galaxy formation, shock heating to roughly the virial temperature of the galaxy potential well (T~ 106 K for a Milky Way type galaxy) before cooling, condensing and forming stars. However, the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower temperatures, typically T < 105 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures is clearly bimodal. The `cold mode' of gas accretion dominates for low-mass galaxies (baryonic mass Mgal<~ 1010.3Msolar or halo mass Mhalo<~ 1011.4Msolar), while the conventional `hot mode' dominates the growth of high-mass systems. Cold accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of cold and hot accretion rates, with the cold mode dominating at high redshift and in low-density regions today, and the hot mode dominating in group and cluster environments at low redshift. The simulations reproduce an important feature of the observed relation between the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and the environment, namely a break in star formation rates at surface densities Sigma~ 1h275 Mpc-2, outside the virial radii of large groups and clusters. The cosmic SFR tracks the overall history of gas accretion, and its decline at low redshift follows the combined decline of cold and hot accretion rates. The drop in cold accretion is driven by the decreasing infall rate on to haloes, while for hot accretion this slower mass growth is further modified by the longer cooling times within haloes. If we allowed hot accretion to be suppressed by conduction or active galactic nuclei feedback, then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colours of ellipticals and the cut-off of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition at Mhalo~ 1011.4Msolar between cold-mode domination and hot-mode domination is similar to that found by Birnboim & Dekel using one-dimensional simulations and analytic arguments. The corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which Kauffmann et al. find a marked shift in galaxy properties, and we speculate on possible connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.},

@article{Birnboim:2003aa,
	Abstract = {We investigate the conditions for the existence of an expanding virial shock in the gas falling within a spherical dark matter halo. The shock relies on pressure support by the shock-heated gas behind it. When the radiative cooling is efficient compared with the infall rate, the post-shock gas becomes unstable; it collapses inwards and cannot support the shock. We find for a monatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock pressure and density obey . When expressed in terms of the pre-shock gas properties at radius r it reads as rhorLambda(T)/u3 < 0.0126, where rho is the gas density, u is the infall velocity and Lambda(T) is the cooling function, with the post-shock temperature T~u2. This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most haloes that form before z~ 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a few 1011 Msolar. In such haloes, the infalling gas is not heated to the virial temperature until it hits the disc, thus avoiding the cooling-dominated quasi-static contraction phase. The direct collapse of the cold gas into the disc should have non-trivial effects on the star formation rate and on outflows. The soft X-ray produced by the shock-heated gas in the disc is expected to ionize the dense disc environment, and the subsequent recombination would result in a high flux of Lalpha emission. This may explain both the puzzling low flux of soft X-ray background and the Lalpha emitters observed at high redshift.},

@article{Haywood:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Quenching, the cessation of star formation, is one of the most significant events in the life cycle of galaxies. While quenching is generally thought to be linked to their central regions, the mechanism responsible for it is not known and may not even be unique. We show here the first evidence that the Milky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end of its thick-disk formation ~9 Gyr ago. The fossil record imprinted on the elemental abundances of stars studied in the solar vicinity and as part of the APOGEE survey (APOGEE is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III) reveals indeed that in less than ~2 Gyr (from 10 to 8 Gyr ago) the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order of magnitude. Because of the tight correlation that exists between age and alpha abundance, the general cessation of the star formation activity reflects in the dearth of stars along the inner-disk sequence in the [Fe/H]-[alpha/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the Milky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at a much lower level to form the thin disk. These events observed in our Galaxy are very well matched by the latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late-type galaxies, the quenching mechanism is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion of gas. Our results show that in the Milky Way, the shut-down occurred on a much shorter timescale, while the chemical continuity between the stellar populations formed before and after the quenching indicates that it is not the exhaustion of the gas that was responsible for the cessation of the star formation. While quenching is generally associated with spheroids in the literature, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way, where the classical bulge is thought to be small or non-existent, possibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin disks. Given the demographics of late-type galaxies in the local Universe, in which classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true generally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately of M*, where quenching could directly be a consequence of thick-disk formation, while quenching may be related to development of spheroids in higher mass galaxies. We emphasize that the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and related to, the formation of the bar, at the end of the thick-disk phase. We sketch a scenario on how a strong bar may inhibit star formation.},

@article{Martig:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than ~1012 M sun. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift.},

@article{Yesuf:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Post-starbursts are galaxies in transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Although they are rare today, integrated over time they may be an important pathway to the red sequence. This work uses Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully quenched post-starbursts (QPSBs) in the narrow mass range log M(M &sun;) = 10.3-10.7, and identifies "transiting" post-starbursts (TPSBs) which are intermediate between these two populations. In this mass range, ~0.3% of galaxies are starbursts, ~0.1% are QPSBs, and ~0.5% are the transiting types in between. The TPSBs have stellar properties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological characteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is about three times higher (gsim 36% $\pm$ 8%) than that of normal star forming galaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the starburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age difference of >~ 200 $\pm$ 100 Myr), in agreement with previous studies. The time delay is inferred by comparing the broadband near-NUV-to-optical photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that starbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust obscured than normal star forming galaxies in the same mass range. About 20% of the starbursts and 15% of the TPSBs can be classified as "dust-obscured galaxies" (DOGs), with a near-UV-to-mid-IR flux ratio of >~ 900, while only 0.8% of normal galaxies are DOGs. The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that AGNs do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may be responsible for quenching later low-level star formation by removing gas and dust during the post-starburst phase.},

	Abstract = {The cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshift z= 2. We use two large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion and to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop in the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global cold-mode accretion rate density on to haloes, but with a delay of the order of the gas consumption time-scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode (hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature never exceeded (did exceed) 105.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks at zâ‰ˆ 3, the hot mode continues to increase to zâ‰ˆ 1 and remains roughly constant thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global accretion rate on to haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes on to galaxies. AGN feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing the gas that entered haloes in the hot mode from accreting on to their central galaxies. Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop-off in the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

@article{Kauffmann:2000aa,
	Abstract = {We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter-dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few per cent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a time-scale of a few times 107yr. With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift, and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number density of quasars from z~2 to z=0 is a result of the combination of three effects: (i) a decrease in the merging rate; (ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and (iii) an increase in the time-scale for gas accretion. The predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped Lyalpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes, quasars and starburst galaxies is inextricably linked to the hierarchical build-up of galaxies.},

@article{De-Lucia:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z ~ 5, 80 per cent at z ~ 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z ~ 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counterparts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

	Abstract = {Massive galaxies today typically are not forming stars despite being surrounded by hot gaseous haloes with short central cooling times. This likely owes to some form of `quenching feedback' such as merger-driven quasar activity or radio jets emerging from central black holes. Here we implement heuristic prescriptions for these phenomena on-the-fly within cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We constrain them by comparing to observed luminosity functions and colour-magnitude diagrams from the SDSS. We find that quenching from mergers alone does not produce a realistic red sequence, because 1-2 Gyr after a merger the remnant accretes new fuel and star formation re-ignites. In contrast, quenching by continuously adding thermal energy to hot gaseous haloes quantitatively matches the red galaxy luminosity function and produces a reasonable red sequence. Small discrepancies remain - a shallow red-sequence slope suggests that our models underestimate metal production or retention in massive red galaxies, while a deficit of massive blue galaxies may reflect the fact that observed heating is intermittent rather than continuous. Overall, injection of energy into hot halo gas appears to be a necessary and sufficient condition to broadly produce red and dead massive galaxies as observed.},

	Abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.},

	Abstract = {We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z ~ 0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of ~L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

@article{Feldmann:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We trace the evolution of central galaxies in three ~1013 M sun galaxy groups simulated at high resolution in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In all three cases, the evolution in the group potential leads, at z = 0, to central galaxies that are massive, gas-poor early-type systems supported by stellar velocity dispersion and which resemble either elliptical or S0 galaxies. Their z ~ 2-2.5 main progenitors are massive (M * ~ (3-10) Ã— 1010 M sun), star-forming (20-60 M sun yr-1) galaxies which host substantial reservoirs of cold gas (~5 Ã— 109 M sun) in extended gas disks. Our simulations thus show that star-forming galaxies observed at z ~ 2 are likely the main progenitors of central galaxies in galaxy groups at z = 0. At z ~ 2 the stellar component of all galaxies is compact, with a half-mass radius <1 kpc. The central stellar density stays approximatively constant from such early epochs down to z = 0. Instead, the galaxies grow inside out, by acquiring a stellar envelope outside the innermost ~2 kpc. Consequently the density within the effective radius decreases by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Both major and minor mergers contribute to most (70+20 -15%) of the mass accreted outside the effective radius and thus drive an episodical evolution of the half-mass radii, particularly below z = 1. In situ star formation and secular evolution processes contribute to 14+18 -9% and 16+6 -11%, respectively. Overall, the simulated galaxies grow by a factor ~4-5 in mass and size since redshift z ~ 2. The short cooling time in the center of groups can foster a "hot accretion" mode. In one of the three simulated groups this leads to a dramatic rejuvenation of the central group galaxy at z < 1, affecting its morphology, kinematics, and colors. This episode is eventually terminated by a group-group merger. Mergers also appear to be responsible for the suppression of cooling flows in the other two groups. Passive stellar evolution and minor galaxy mergers gradually restore the early-type character of the central galaxy in the cooling flow group on a timescale of ~1-2 Gyr. Although the average properties of central galaxies may be set by their halo masses, our simulations demonstrate that the interplay between halo mass assembly, galaxy merging, and gas accretion has a substantial influence on the star formation histories and z = 0 morphologies of central galaxies in galaxy groups.},

	Abstract = {The bimodality in observed present-day galaxy colours has long been a challenge for hierarchical galaxy formation models, as it requires some physical process to quench (and keep quenched) star formation in massive galaxies. Here, we examine phenomenological models of quenching by post-processing the star formation histories of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that reproduce observations of star-forming galaxies reasonably well. We consider recipes for quenching based on major mergers, halo mass thresholds, gas temperature thresholds and variants thereof. We compare the resulting simulated star formation histories to observed g - r colour-magnitude diagrams and red and blue luminosity functions from SDSS. The merger and halo mass quenching scenarios each yield a distinct red sequence and blue cloud of galaxies that are in broad agreement with data, albeit only under rather extreme assumptions. In detail, however, the simulated red sequence slope and amplitude in both scenarios are somewhat discrepant, perhaps traceable to low metallicities in simulated galaxies. Merger quenching produces more massive blue galaxies, earlier quenching and more frosting of young stars; comparing to relevant data tends to favour merger over halo mass quenching. Although physically motivated quenching models can produce a red sequence, interesting generic discrepancies remain that indicate that additional physics is required to reproduce the star formation and enrichment histories of red and dead galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We study the effects of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems in the COSMOS field at $z\lesssim$ 3. We show that at $z\lesssim$ 1, the median star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on environment, but they become independent of environment at $z\gtrsim$ 1. However, we find that only for \textit{star-forming} galaxies, the median SFR and sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and stellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at $z\lesssim$ 1, and on stellar mass out to $z\sim$ 3. We show that at $z\lesssim$ 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that the overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time. Environmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At $z\lesssim$ 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$ 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency ($\epsilon_{mass}$) for more massive galaxies (log($M/M_{\odot}$)$\gtrsim$ 10.2) rises with cosmic time until $z\sim$ 1 and flattens out since then. However, for less massive galaxies, the rise in $\epsilon_{mass}$ continues to the present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only relevant at $z\lesssim$ 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the dominant mechanism at $z\gtrsim$ 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and dark matter (DM) can be characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 Ã— 1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4 Ã— 1012h-1Msolar, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of 17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and 16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at 1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 Ã— 1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density, and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is dominated by haloes in the mass range 1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

	Abstract = {Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ``strangulation'', in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 1011 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 1011 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

	Abstract = {We examine the cosmic growth of the red sequence in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic prescription for quenching star formation that yields a realistic passive galaxy population today. In this prescription, haloes dominated by hot gas are continually heated to prevent their coronae from fuelling new star formation. Hot coronae primarily form in haloes above Ëœ1012 M&sun;, so that galaxies with stellar masses Ëœ1010.5 M&sun; are the first to be quenched and move on to the red sequence at z > 2. The red sequence is concurrently populated at low masses by satellite galaxies in large haloes that are starved of new fuel, resulting in a dip in passive galaxy number densities around Ëœ1010 M&sun;. Stellar mass growth continues for galaxies even after joining the red sequence, primarily through minor mergers with a typical mass ratio Ëœ1:5. For the most massive systems, the size growth implied by the distribution of merger mass ratios is typically approximately two times the corresponding mass growth, consistent with observations. This model reproduces mass-density and colour-density trends in the local Universe, with essentially no evolution to z = 1, with the hint that such relations may be washed out by z Ëœ 2. Simulated galaxies are increasingly likely to be red at high masses or high local overdensities. In our model, the presence of surrounding hot gas drives the trends with both mass and environment.},

	Abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalog constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder, we investigate the luminosity and stellar mass functions for different populations of galaxies (central versus satellite, red versus blue, and galaxies in groups of different masses) and for groups themselves. The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about three times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low-mass end. At the very low mass end (M * lsim 109 h -2 M sun), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at ~4 Ã— 1010 h -2 M sun. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function of central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation for low-mass halos, and obtain M *,c  vprop M 4.9  h  for Mh Lt 1011 h -1 M sun.},

	Abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M * > 5 Ã— 1010 M &sun; and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * ~ 27 at M * = 4.5 Ã— 1010 M &sun; and Mh = 1.2 Ã— 1012 M &sun;. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot halo mass," M piv  h , and the "pivot ratio," (Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv  h  and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13 Ã— 1010 M &sun; at z = 0.88 to M piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 Ã— 1010 M &sun; at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M piv  h  leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv ~ 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

	Abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M &sun; are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LambdaCDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

@article{Hopkins:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. The data show a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z<~1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative uncertainties. Since the z<~1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit on the electron antineutrino (nue) flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses (<~1 Msolar), and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from core-collapse supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We use the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic Legacy Survey (SWIRE) to explore the specific star formation activity of galaxies and their evolution near the peak of the cosmic far-infrared (FIR) background at 70 and 160 mum. We use a stacking analysis to determine the mean FIR properties of well-defined subsets of galaxies at flux levels well below the FIR catalogue detection limits of SWIRE and other Spitzer surveys. We tabulate the contribution of different subsets of galaxies to the FIR background at 70 and 160 mum. These long wavelengths provide a good constraint on the bolometric obscured emission. The large area provides good constraints at low z and in finer redshift bins than previous work. At all redshifts we find that the specific FIR luminosity decreases with increasing mass, following a trend LFIR/M* ~ Mbeta* with beta = -0.38 +/- 0.14. This is a more continuous change than expected from the De Lucia & Blaizot semi-analytic model suggesting modifications to the feedback prescriptions. We see an increase in the specific FIR luminosity by about a factor of ~100 from 0 < z < 2 and find that the specific FIR luminosity evolves as (1 + z)alpha with alpha = 4.4 +/- 0.3 for galaxies with 10.5 < log10 M*/Msolar <= 12. This is considerably steeper than the De Lucia & Blaizot semi-analytic model (alpha ~ 2.5). When separating galaxies into early and late types on the basis of the optical/IR spectral energy distributions we find that the decrease in specific FIR luminosity with stellar mass is stronger in early-type galaxies (beta ~ -0.46), while late-type galaxies exhibit a flatter trend (beta ~ -0.15). The evolution is strong for both classes but stronger for the early-type galaxies. The early types show a trend of decreasing strength of evolution as we move from lower to higher masses while the evolution of the late-type galaxies has little dependence on stellar mass. We suggest that in late-type galaxies we are seeing a consistently declining specific star formation rate alpha = 3.36 +/- 0.16 through a common phenomenon, for example, exhaustion of gas supply, i.e. not systematically dependent on the local properties of the galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for galaxies of different stellar mass by drawing on a deep 3.6 mum selected sample of >105 galaxies in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 < z < 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z) n , where n ~ 4.3 for all galaxies and n ~ 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z>2, at least for high-mass (M * >~ 4 Ã— 1010 M sun) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR vprop M * beta, between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M * â‰ˆ 1010 M sun if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index betaSFG â‰ˆ -0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR-M * relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive (>1010 M sun) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong "downsizing" in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z ~ 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M * = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M sun. In this sense, too, there is no "downsizing." Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.},

	Abstract = {We use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing within the COSMOS survey to constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshift range z = [0.2, 1.0]. For massive galaxies, M * >~ 1010.6 M &sun;, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * ~ 1010 M &sun;, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

@article{Peng:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that dwarf galaxies (107 < M stellar < 109 M &sun;, -12 > Mr > -18) with no active star formation are extremely rare (<0.06%) in the field. Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no Halpha emission (EWHalpha < 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5 Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5 Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of M stellar < 1.0 Ã— 109 M &sun; below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1sigma upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06%. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23% of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 Ã— 109 M &sun;, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback.},

	Abstract = {Context. Groups of galaxies are a common environment, bridging the gap between starforming field galaxies and quiescent cluster galaxies. Within groups secular processes could be at play, contributing to the observed strong decrease of star formation with cosmic time in the global galaxy population.  Aims: We took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first  10 000 galaxies of the zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study in detail the complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties.  Methods: The classical indicator Fblue, i.e., the fraction of blue galaxies, proved to be a simple but powerful diagnostic tool. We studied its variation for different luminosity and mass selected galaxy samples, divided as to define groups/field/isolated galaxy subsamples.  Results: Using rest-frame evolving B-band volume-limited samples, the groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases, but maintains a systematic difference (a lower Fblue) with respect to the global galaxy population, and an even larger difference with respect to the isolated galaxy population. However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent that such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright blue galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. By carefully focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomes negligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored, i.e., log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) <= 10.6 , does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function of environment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses.  Conclusions: Our results indicate that red galaxies of mass log ({\cal M}*/{\cal M}&sun;) >= 10.8 are already in place at z   1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly originating from so-called nature or internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower galaxy masses and redshifts lower than z   1, we observe the emergence in groups of a population of nurture red galaxies: slightly deviating from the trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, and more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit signatures of group-related secular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution. Our analysis implies that these mechanisms begin to significantly influence galaxy evolution after z   1, a redshift corresponding to the emergence of structures in which these mechanisms take place.  based on data obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 175.A-0839, PI: S.

	Abstract = {We explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over 0.1 < z < 0.7 using the final zCOSMOS-bright data set. Using the red fraction of galaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction of red galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity delta and with the stellar mass M*, consistent with previous works. As at lower redshift, the red fraction appears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of two processes: mass Îµm(M*) and environmental Îµrho(delta) quenching. The parameters describing these appear to be essentially the same at z Ëœ 0.7 as locally. We explore the relation between red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellite galaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in the central-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samples well matched in stellar mass. There is little evidence for a dependence of the red fraction of centrals on overdensity. Satellites are consistently redder at all overdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency, Îµsat(delta, M*), increases with overdensity at 0.1 < z < 0.4. This is less marked at higher redshift, but both are nevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. At a given stellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, fsat(delta, M*), also increases with overdensity. The obtained Îµrho(delta)/fsat(delta, M*) agrees well with Îµsat(delta, M*), demonstrating that the environmental quenching in the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced by a satellite quenching process at least up to z = 0.7. However, despite the unprecedented size of our high-redshift samples, the associated statistical uncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood as approximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanning a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxies evolve onto the red sequence. The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what fraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. At all redshifts, including z = 0, the data are consistent with ~60% of satellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red sequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red satellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto a larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields a quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same way as halo dynamical times: t Q ~ (1 + z)-1.5. In three of the four samples, the data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all central galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make the transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the fourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star formation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A scenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker correlation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger scenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5. These results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red evolves from z = 0.5 to z = 0.},

	Abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LambdaCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at zlesssim 2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z = 0 for virial masses in the range 1011 h-1 M&sun; <= M<= 1015 h-1 M&sun; to lesssim5%, improving on previous results by a factor of 2-3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z = 0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal function at this level or accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by â‰ˆ20%-50%, depending on the mass definition, from z = 0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

	Abstract = {The kinematics of satellite galaxies reflect the masses of the extended dark matter haloes in which they orbit, and thus shed light on the mass-luminosity relation (MLR) of their corresponding central galaxies. In this paper, we select a large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite galaxies as a function of the r-band luminosity of the central galaxies. Using the analytical framework presented in More, van den Bosch & Cacciato, we use these data to infer both the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully taking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking procedure. As expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massive haloes. In addition, we find that the scatter in halo masses for centrals of a given luminosity, sigmalogM, also increases with increasing luminosity. As we demonstrate, this is consistent with sigmalogL, which reflects the scatter in the conditional probability function P(Lc|M), being independent of halo mass. Our analysis of the satellite kinematics yields sigmalogL = 0.16 +/- 0.04, in excellent agreement with constraints from clustering and group catalogues, and with predictions from a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We thus conclude that the amount of stochasticity in galaxy formation, which is characterized by sigmalogL, is well constrained, independent of halo mass and in a good agreement with current models of galaxy formation.},

These numbers decrease to 50% and 40%, respectively, in halos with Mh ~ 1012 h-1 M&sun;. For halos of a given mass, the distribution of the luminosities of central galaxies, Lc, has a dispersion of about 0.15 dex. The mean luminosity (stellar mass) of the central galaxies scales with halo mass as Lc propto Mh0.17 (M*,c propto Mh0.22) for halos with masses M gg 1012.5 h-1 M&sun;, and both relations are significantly steeper for less massive halos. We also measure the luminosity and stellar mass gaps between the first and second brightest (most massive) member galaxies, log L1 - log L2 (log M*,1 - log M*,2). These gap statistics, especially in halos with Mhlesssim 1014.0 h-1 M&sun;, indicate that the luminosities of central galaxies are clearly distinct from those of their satellites. The fraction of fossil groups, defined as those groups with log L1 - log L2 >= 0.8, ranges from ~2.5% for groups with Mh ~ 1014 h-1 M&sun; to 18%-60% for groups with Mh ~ 1013 h-1 M&sun;. Finally, we measure the fraction of satellites, which changes from ~5.0% for galaxies with 0.1Mr - 5 log h ~ - 22.0 to ~40% for galaxies with 0.1Mr - 5 log h ~ - 17.0.},

	Abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z~1) and SDSS (z~0) galaxies within the HOD framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z~0 central galaxies to z~1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z~0 low-mass halos (~5Ã—1011 h-1 Msolar) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass halos (~1013 h-1 Msolar) result from star formation between z~1 and z~0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.},

@article{Li:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We use a complete and uniform sample of almost half a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to characterize the distribution of stellar mass in the low-redshift Universe. Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and are reasonably but not perfectly fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 Ã— 1010Msolar and with faint-end slope alpha = -1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp < 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc < rp < 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is xi*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84. Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp < 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance Lambdacold dark matter cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude sigma8 ~ 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for the nature of Dark Energy.},

@article{Yang:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associated with the population of dark matter subhalos. The assumption usually made is that the relationship between satellite galaxies and subhalos is similar to that between central galaxies and host halos. In this paper, we use the conditional stellar mass functions of satellite galaxies obtained from a large galaxy group catalog together with models of the subhalo mass functions to explore the consequences of such assumption in connection to the stellar mass function of satellite galaxies and the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxy groups and clusters of different masses. The majority of the stripped stars in massive halos are predicted to end up as intracluster stars, and the predicted amounts of the intracluster component as a function of the velocity dispersion of galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by Gonzalez et al. (2007). The fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain bound in the central and satellite galaxies is the highest (~40% of the total stellar mass) in halos with masses Mh ~ 1014 h -1 M sun. If all these stars end up in the intracluster component (Max), or a maximum amount of these stars is accreted into the central galaxy (Min), then the maximum fraction of the total stars in the whole universe that is in the diffused intracluster component is ~19%, and the minimum is ~5%. In the case of "Max," the stellar mass of the intracluster component in massive halos with Mh ~ 1015 h -1 M sun is roughly six times as large as that of the central galaxy. This factor decreases to ~2, 1, and 0.1 in halos with Mh ~ 1014, 1013, and 1012 h -1 M sun, respectively. The total amount of stars stripped from satellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in halos with masses lsim1012.5 h -1 M sun, and so the quenching of star formation must occur in halos with higher masses. In semianalytical models and simulations that do not resolve the diffused component, caution must be exercised when using the observed stellar mass/luminosity function of galaxies to constrain the star formation, feedback and merger processes in dark matter halos.},

@article{Leja:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how to associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density rather than fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al. semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically, we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection reproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities. We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally based corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex). We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat uncertain.},

	Abstract = {We employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance LambdaCDM cosmology (Omega0=1-OmegaLambda=0.3, h=0.7, sigma8=0.9) to model the observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxy clustering through most of the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. We use a simple, nonparametric model, which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations, Vaccmax reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation, Vnowmax. The simulations and our model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1 over the entire probed range of projected separations, 0.1<rp/(h-1 Mpc)<10.0. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn. This suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter halos.},

@article{Vale:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Non-parametric, empirically based, models for associating galaxy luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale & Ostriker version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass, cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as Ltot ~M0.88, while the luminosity of the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L1 ~ M0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately L ~ M4.5 for M ~ 1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as ~M0.9.  In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for Omegam and sigma8. Within the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around Omegam = 0.25 and sigma8 = 0.8; this is also in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.},

	Abstract = {Galaxies are believed to be in one-to-one correspondence with simulated dark matter subhaloes. We use high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological volumes to calculate the statistical properties of subhalo (galaxy) major mergers at high redshift (z = 0.6-5). We measure the evolution of the galaxy merger rate, finding that it is much shallower than the merger rate of dark matter host haloes at z > 2.5, but roughly parallels that of haloes at z < 1.6. We also track the detailed merger histories of individual galaxies and measure the likelihood of multiple mergers per halo or subhalo. We examine satellite merger statistics in detail: 15-35 per cent of all recently merged galaxies are satellites, and satellites are twice as likely as centrals to have had a recent major merger. Finally, we show how the differing evolution of the merger rates of haloes and galaxies leads to the evolution of the average satellite occupation per halo, noting that for a fixed halo mass, the satellite halo occupation peaks at z ~ 2.5.},

	Abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

@article{White:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion).  We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators.  We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group finders to recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. To test the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red versus blue galaxies or centrals versus satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e. running group finders over mock data) or by implementing a correction scheme based on the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model dependent.},

@article{Tinker:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal <~ 10^10.0 Msol/h^2), there is no correlation between f_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

@article{Chabrier:2003aa,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

	Abstract = {Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0<z<1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types---spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems---and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

@article{Cooper:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Using a sample of 19464 galaxies drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between galaxy colour and environment at 0.4 < z < 1.35. We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends strongly on local environment out to z > 1, being larger in regions of greater galaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red, morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured overdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local overdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z > 1 detected at a greater than 5sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find that the colour-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more strongly favouring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence counterparts at high redshift. At z >~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly correlates with overdensity, implying that any colour dependence to the clustering of ~L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add weight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence has occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e. galaxy groups) at z <~ 1.5. Furthermore, we identify the epoch (z ~ 2) at which typical ~L* galaxies began quenching and moved on to the red sequence in significant number. The strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 < z < 1.35 suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-density and colour-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms (i.e. `nurture') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by `nature') upon the galaxy population during their epoch of formation.},

@article{Cooper:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We use data drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey to investigate the relationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass and rest-frame galaxy colour. At z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at the high-mass [ log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) > 10.1] end depends on the local environment, with high-density regions favouring more massive systems. Accounting for this stellar mass-environment relation (i.e. working at fixed stellar mass), we find a significant colour-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 < log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) < 11.1 and 0.75 < z < 0.95. This result is shown to be robust to variations in the sample selection and to extend to even lower masses [down to log 10(M*/h-2 Msolar) ~ 10.4]. We conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works in the literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxy properties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift and stellar mass domain. The non-detection of environmental dependence found in other data sets is largely attributable to their smaller sample sizes and lower sampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshifts and biased analysis techniques. Ultimately, our results based on DEEP2 data illustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusively determined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. Instead, we show that local environment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxy properties at z > 1.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {We present the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS), a spectroscopic faint galaxy redshift survey to z ~ 1. PRIMUS uses a low-dispersion prism and slitmasks to observe ~2500 objects at once in a 0.18 deg2 field of view, using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph camera on the Magellan I Baade 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. PRIMUS covers a total of 9.1 deg2 of sky to a depth of i AB ~ 23.5 in seven different deep, multi-wavelength fields that have coverage from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and either XMM or Chandra, as well as multiple-band optical and near-IR coverage. PRIMUS includes ~130,000 robust redshifts of unique objects with a redshift precision of sigma z /(1 + z) ~ 0.005. The redshift distribution peaks at z ~ 0.6 and extends to z = 1.2 for galaxies and z = 5 for broad-line active galactic nuclei. The motivation, observational techniques, fields, target selection, slitmask design, and observations are presented here, with a brief summary of the redshift precision; a forthcoming paper presents the data reduction, redshift fitting, redshift confidence, and survey completeness. PRIMUS is the largest faint galaxy survey undertaken to date. The high targeting fraction (~80%) and large survey size will allow for precise measures of galaxy properties and large-scale structure to z ~ 1.},

@article{Drory:2009aa,
	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of stellar mass functions in the COSMOS field to fainter limits than has been previously probed at z <= 1. The increase in dynamic range reveals features in the shape of the stellar mass function that deviate from a single Schechter function. Neither the total nor the red (passive) or blue (star-forming) galaxy stellar mass functions can be well fitted with a single Schechter function once the mass completeness limit of the sample probes below ~3 Ã— 109 M sun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses ~1010 M sun, just below the traditional M*, and an upturn toward a steep faint-end slope of alpha ~ -1.7 at lower mass at all redshifts <=1. This bimodal nature of the mass function is not solely a result of the blue/red dichotomy. Indeed, the blue mass function is by itself bimodal at z ~ 1. This suggests a new dichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence. We propose two interpretations for this bimodal distribution. If the gas fraction increases toward lower mass, galaxies with M baryon ~ 1010 M sun would shift to lower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change in star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming much more efficient below ~1010 M sun. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in the baryonic (stars+gas) mass function. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at ~1011 M sun, a phenomenon that naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M halo ~ 1012 M sun. In this scenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M * would be identified with central galaxies and the second fainter component of the mass function having a steep faint-end slope with satellite galaxies. The low-mass end of the blue and total mass functions exhibit a steeper slope than has been detected in previous work that may increasingly approach the halo mass function value of -2. While the dip feature is apparent in the total mass function at all redshifts, it appears to shift from the blue to the red population, likely as a result of transforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect a drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies. Their increase with time seems to reflect a decrease in the number of blue systems and so we tentatively associate them with satellite dwarf (spheroidal) galaxies that have undergone quenching due to environmental processes.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i < 23 flux-limited sample of ~40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling â‰ˆ5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ~170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a â‰ˆ30% increase in the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z â‰ˆ 0.6, and a <~ 10% change in the number density of all >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } galaxies since z â‰ˆ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z â‰ˆ 0.6, whereas the space density of >~ 1011  {M}_{\odot } star-forming galaxies decreases by â‰ˆ50% between z â‰ˆ 1 and z â‰ˆ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~1010  {M}_{\odot } quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z â‰ˆ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z â‰ˆ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~1010.8  {M}_{\odot }. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z < 1, even among massive (gsim 1011  {M}_{\odot }) quiescent galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyse a z < 0.1 galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey focusing on the variation in the galaxy colour bimodality with stellar mass and projected neighbour density Sigma, and on measurements of the galaxy stellar mass functions. The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 1010.6 to (Kroupa initial mass function, H0 = 70) for Sigma in the range 0.1-10Mpc-2. The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in logSigma and bins). The red fraction fr generally increases continuously in both Sigma and such that there is a unified relation: . Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effects of galaxy environment on the evolution of the quiescent fraction ({{f}Q}) from z=0.8 to 0.0 using spectroscopic redshifts and multi-wavelength imaging data from the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our stellar mass limited galaxy sample consists of Ëœ14,000 PRIMUS galaxies within z = 0.2-0.8 and Ëœ64,000 SDSS galaxies within z = 0.05-0.12. We classify the galaxies as quiescent or star-forming (SF) based on an evolving specific star formation cut, and as low or high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture environment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining population. For quiescent and SF galaxies in low or high density environments, we examine the evolution of their stellar mass function (SMF). Then using the SMFs we compute {{f}Q}({{M}*}) and quantify its evolution within our redshift range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at higher masses and in denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises with cosmic time for all masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of {{10}10.5} {{M}&sun; }, from zËœ 0.7 to 0.1, the quiescent fraction rises by 15% at the lowest environments and by 25% at the highest environments we measure. These results suggest that for a minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to external influences on them. In other words, in the recent universe a substantial fraction of the galaxies that cease forming stars do so due to internal processes.},

@article{Gu:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the $z=0$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\lesssim$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale ($M_{\rm vir}>10^{14}{M_\odot}$) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is $\approx0.16$ dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since $z\approx2$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of $0.2$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from $10^{12}{M_\odot}<M_{\rm vir}<10^{14.75}{M_\odot}$. The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at $z=0$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is determined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

	Abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

	Abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the `red sequence' than central (`field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching time-scales of satellites of Mstar > 5 Ã— 109 M&sun; at z â‰ˆ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z Ëœ 0.5, or Ëœ5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at Mstar < 1010 M&sun;. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of <0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

@article{Blanton:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.
