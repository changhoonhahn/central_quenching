# Referee Report


> The authors examined the quenching timescale of central galaxies based on observed evolutionary trends of the star formation main sequence, quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at z<1, coupled with a high resolution cosmological N-body simulation. They also gave a good review of the potential quenching mechanisms for central galaxies. The main result of this paper is that the quenching timescale of central galaxies is systematically higher than that of satellite galaxies, and it favors the models of strangulation and morphological quenching. 



> This is a highly valuable work that provides strict constraints to the potential quenching mechanisms. I have no doubt that this paper merits publication. However, I do have several comments below. These should to be addressed before I recommend publication. 




> 1) In this work, the observed SSFR distribution at z~0, especially the height of green valley, is critical to constraining the quenching timescale. The authors obtained the SSFR distribution from Brinchmann et al. 2004 who measured SFR using emission lines for galaxies with high SFR and D4000 for quiescent galaxies. However, multiple SFR indicators may introduce considerable systematic error to the SSFR distribution. As shown in Figure 11 in Brinchmann et al. 2004, D4000 does not correlate well with the SSFR for passive galaxies. Moreover, the aperture correction for the spectroscopically-derived SFR, which is based on broad-band photometry, may also introduce considerable uncertainty. Besides, SFR derived from emission lines reflects the SF activity on a 10Myr timescale. This makes the SFR measurements sensitive to short term variations in star formation history (SFH), such as small instantaneous burst.


>Therefore, I suggest the authors to check the SSFR distribution derived from UV (such as Salim et al. 2007) which is applicable for different types of galaxies and does not suffer the aperture effect. The SFR derived from UV is also dominated by SF activity on a 100Myr timescale which should be more consistent with the smooth SFH assumed in the paper.  

We have added a section in the Appendix (Section A) to address this comment. In the section, we construct a sample of galaxies that are in both the group catalog and the Moustakas et al. (2013) sample. Then using this sample, we compare the SSFR distribution calculated using the group catalog (Brinchmann et al. 2004) SSFRs to the SSFR distribution calculated using the Moustakas et al. (2013) SSFRs. Moustakas et al. (2013) derives SSFRs from SED fits of broad wavelength photometry that includes UV from GALEX, optical from SDSS, and IR from 2MASS and WISE. These SSFRs do not face the limitations of the Brinchmann et al. (2004) SSFRs mentioned in the comment. They account for UV photometry and does not require any aperture correction. 

As Figure 12 illustrates, the comparison finds good overall agreement between the two SSFR distributions. Furthermore, we find that the heights of the green valley for the distributions, critical for constraining the central quenching timescale, are also in good agreement. Therefore, we conclude that the central quenching timescale results of the paper are robust. 


>2) The authors mention that the SSFRs less than 10^-12 yr^-1 are upper limits. Does the calculation of distance metric in Section 5 include these upper limits? If true, will the best-fitting quenching timescale change a lot if we ignore these upper limits or quiescent galaxies in SSFR distribution?

We include the following explanation in Section 5.1. The distance metric described in Section 5 does not include the upper limits of the Brinchmann et al. (2004) SSFRs. Instead we incorporate the upper limits into our model. Because we design the model to reproduce the impact that the SSFR limits have on the observed group catalog SSFR distribution, the central quenching timescale will not be impacted. Furthermore, we have redrafted parts of Section 4.3 in order to clarify how the upper limits of the Brinchmann et al. (2004) SSFRs are incoprorated in the model. 

>3) One of the reasons for spectroscopically-derived SFR is to obtain a cleaner separation between SF and quiescent galaxies at z~0 than a simple color cut. However, the quiescent fractions at higher redshift taken from Tinker et al. 2013 were obtained using NUV-R and R-J color-color cut. Would these different classification methods at different redshifts affect the results? The authors could separate the SF and quiescent galaxies at z~0 using a color cut similar to that in Tinker et al. 2013 to check this.


We have added a section in the Appendix (Section B) to address this comment. We compile photometry from GALEX, NASA-Sloan Atlas, and 2MASS catalogs to examine the (NUV-R)-(R-J) color-color relation for galaxies in the SDSS DR7 group catalog. We compare the quiescent galaxy population classified using the SFR-M* cut to the (NUV-R) and (R-J) color-color cuts derived Bundy et al. (2010) and Tinker et al. (2013) (Figure 13). Furthermore, we compare the quiescent fraction derived for the SDSS DR7 group catalog using the two classification methods (Figure 14). Figures 13 and 14 confirm that the different star-forming/quiescent classifications are consistent with one another. 

>4) It can be seen from Figure 5 that there is a mild degeneracy between the quenching timescale and quenching probability. The reliability of obtained quenching timescale partly relies on how well the quenching probability is constrained. Therefore, I expect the authors to compare their result of quenching probability with those derived in previous works, such as Moustakas et al. 2013, and the recent work by Lian et al. 2016. 

We agree with the referee that this comparison is worthwhile and have added paragraphs in Section 5.2 that discuss the quenching probability derived from the posterior distributions of our model parameters. We compare the quenching probability to the quenching rates of Moustakas et al. (2013) and Lian et al. (2016). We find that the quenching probabilities are generally in good agreement with the quenching rates. However, as now described in the text, we refrain a more detailed comparison because our quenching probabillity is for central galaxies and there are discrepancies between the definition of quenching proability and quenching rate. Furthermore, there are discrepancies between the SMF and quiescent fraction evolutions used to derive the quenching probability and quenching rates.

We also clarify the definition of quenching probability in Section 4.3, which previously was misleading.
