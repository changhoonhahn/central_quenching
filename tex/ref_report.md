# Referee Report


> The authors examined the quenching timescale of central galaxies based on observed evolutionary trends of the star formation main sequence, quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at z<1, coupled with a high resolution cosmological N-body simulation. They also gave a good review of the potential quenching mechanisms for central galaxies. The main result of this paper is that the quenching timescale of central galaxies is systematically higher than that of satellite galaxies, and it favors the models of strangulation and morphological quenching. 



> This is a highly valuable work that provides strict constraints to the potential quenching mechanisms. I have no doubt that this paper merits publication. However, I do have several comments below. These should to be addressed before I recommend publication. 




> 1) In this work, the observed SSFR distribution at z~0, especially the height of green valley, is critical to constraining the quenching timescale. The authors obtained the SSFR distribution from Brinchmann et al. 2004 who measured SFR using emission lines for galaxies with high SFR and D4000 for quiescent galaxies. However, multiple SFR indicators may introduce considerable systematic error to the SSFR distribution. As shown in Figure 11 in Brinchmann et al. 2004, D4000 does not correlate well with the SSFR for passive galaxies. Moreover, the aperture correction for the spectroscopically-derived SFR, which is based on broad-band photometry, may also introduce considerable uncertainty. Besides, SFR derived from emission lines reflects the SF activity on a 10Myr timescale. This makes the SFR measurements sensitive to short term variations in star formation history (SFH), such as small instantaneous burst.


>Therefore, I suggest the authors to check the SSFR distribution derived from UV (such as Salim et al. 2007) which is applicable for different types of galaxies and does not suffer the aperture effect. The SFR derived from UV is also dominated by SF activity on a 100Myr timescale which should be more consistent with the smooth SFH assumed in the paper.  



>2) The authors mention that the SSFRs less than 10^-12 yr^-1 are upper limits. Does the calculation of distance metric in Section 5 include these upper limits? If true, will the best-fitting quenching timescale change a lot if we ignore these upper limits or quiescent galaxies in SSFR distribution?


>3) One of the reasons for spectroscopically-derived SFR is to obtain a cleaner separation between SF and quiescent galaxies at z~0 than a simple color cut. However, the quiescent fractions at higher redshift taken from Tinker et al. 2013 were obtained using NUV-R and R-J color-color cut. Would these different classification methods at different redshifts affect the results? The authors could separate the SF and quiescent galaxies at z~0 using a color cut similar to that in Tinker et al. 2013 to check this.


In an newly added section of the Appendix, we compile photometry from GALEX, NASA-Sloan Atlas, and 2MASS catalogs to examine the (NUV-R)-(R-J) color-color relation for galaxies in the SDSS DR7 group catalog. We compare the quiescent galaxy population classified using the SFR-M* cut to the (NUV-R) and (R-J) color-color cuts derived Bundy et al. (2010) and Tinker et al. (2013) (Figure 12). Furthermore, we compare the quiescent fraction derived for the SDSS DR7 group catalog using the two classification methods and confirm that they are consistent with each other (Figure 13). 

>4) It can be seen from Figure 5 that there is a mild degeneracy between the quenching timescale and quenching probability. The reliability of obtained quenching timescale partly relies on how well the quenching probability is constrained. Therefore, I expect the authors to compare their result of quenching probability with those derived in previous works, such as Moustakas et al. 2013, and the recent work by Lian et al. 2016.
